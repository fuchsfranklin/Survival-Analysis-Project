# Survival Analysis Project
This repository contains an R Shiny application designed to perform and visualize survival analysis, particularly in the context of COVID-19 infection. The application includes various tables, plots, and statistical analyses to provide a comprehensive understanding of survival data.

## Features

The application includes the following features:

1. __Survival Tables__: The app generates survival tables that summarize the data and provide key statistics.

2. __Survival Plots__: The app creates Kaplan-Meier survival plots, which visualize the survival function over time. It also includes a censoring plot to visualize right-censored survival data.

3. __Statistical Tests__: The app performs Chi-square tests to analyze the relationship between different variables.

4. __Probability Density Functions (PDFs), Cumulative Density Functions (CDFs), and Survival Functions__: The app includes functions to plot the PDF, CDF, and survival function for normal, exponential, and uniform distributions.

5. __Interactive UI__: The app has an interactive user interface that allows users to input parameters for the distribution functions.

## Installation

To run the application, you will need to have R and RStudio installed on your machine.

Once you have R and RStudio installed, you can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/fuchsfranklin/Survival-Analysis-Project.git
```

Then, open the R Shiny application file in RStudio and click "Run App" to start the application.

### Usage

The application is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. Simply input the parameters for the distribution functions and the app will generate the corresponding plots and tables. You can hover over the plots to see more detailed information.
